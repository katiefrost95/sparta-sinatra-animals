### Brief
Your aim is to create a new resource of your choice for example *Posts* for a Blog site or *Cars* for a Transport site.

Your site will need to have the following:-

* All the restful routes for your resource which should be working
* Your routes should be separated out into their own class
* It should include all the relevant ERB templates for the routes that render HTML
* At least two partials
* A layout template
* A new set of data in a static Model
* Links to navigate around the CRUD actions on your site so you dont need to navigate via the url
* Styling to make the site look good **(This will need some research on how to include your CSS)**

### What I delivered
Everything.

### What went well
I really understood the concept of the framework and how to use it. I think the website looks fine and I delivered on everything.

### What didn't go so well
I kept missing tiny details which would hold me up for ages when the webpages would break. Could have added a bit more styling.
