### Brief
Your aim is to create a new resource of your choice for example *Posts* for a Blog site or *Cars* for a Transport site.

Your site will need to have the following:-

* All the restful routes for your resource which should be working
* Your routes should be separated out into their own class
* It should include all the relevant ERB templates for the routes that render HTML
* At least two partials
* A layout template
* A new database using Postgres
* Forms to manage creation and update of resource (Must reuse the forms)
* You data should be persist even when you restart your server
* Links to navigate around the CRUD actions on your site so you don't need to navigate via the url
* Styling to make the site look really really really good

### What I delivered
Everything except for a working edit button.

### What went well
I managed to fix most of the problems I was encountering.

### What didn't go so well
I kept missing tiny details which would hold me up for ages when the webpages would break. Would have liked to have added a bit more styling.
